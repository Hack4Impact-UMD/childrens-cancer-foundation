# Post-Grant Reports Collection

## Overview
The `post-grant-reports` collection stores post-grant report submissions for accepted applications. Each report is linked to a specific application and user.

## Schema

### Document Structure
```typescript
interface PostGrantReport {
    id?: string;                    // Auto-generated document ID
    file?: string;                  // PDF file ID (legacy support)
    pdf?: string;                   // PDF file ID from Firebase Storage
    applicationId: string;          // ID of the associated application
    submittedAt?: Date;             // Timestamp when report was submitted
    deadline?: Date;                // Report deadline (from application cycle)
    investigatorName?: string;      // Principal investigator name
    institutionName?: string;       // Institution name
    attestationDate?: string;       // Date of attestation
    status?: 'pending' | 'submitted' | 'overdue';  // Report status
    userId?: string;                // User ID who submitted the report
    userEmail?: string;             // Email of the submitting user
    applicationTitle?: string;      // Title of the associated application
    grantType?: string;             // Type of grant (research, nextgen, nonresearch)
}
```

## Usage

### Creating Reports
- **Trigger**: User submits post-grant report through the full-screen form
- **Location**: `/applicant/post-grant-report/:applicationId`
- **Process**: 
  1. PDF file uploaded to Firebase Storage
  2. File ID stored in `pdf` field
  3. Report document created with user authentication
  4. Confetti animation shown on success

### Reading Reports
- **Applicants**: Can read their own reports (where `userId` matches `request.auth.uid`)
- **Admins**: Can read all reports for administrative purposes
- **Dashboard**: Shows submission details and PDF viewing links

### Updating Reports
- **Applicants**: Can update their own reports
- **Admins**: Can update any report
- **Note**: Once submitted, reports cannot be edited by applicants (read-only view)

## Security Rules

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /post-grant-reports/{reportId} {
  // Allow applicants to create their own reports
  allow create: if isApplicant() && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Allow applicants to read their own reports
  allow read: if isApplicant() && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Allow applicants to update their own reports
  allow update: if isApplicant() && 
    resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Allow admins to read and update all reports
  allow read, update: if isAdmin();
}
```

### Storage Rules
```javascript
match /pdfs/{fileName} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null
    && request.resource.size < 50 * 1024 * 1024
    && request.resource.contentType.matches('application/pdf');
}
```
