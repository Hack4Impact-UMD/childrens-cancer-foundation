# AssignReviewers

This page is used by administrators to assign reviewers to applications.

## Logic

- It displays a list of applications and a list of reviewers.
- The admin can select an application and then select one or more reviewers to assign to it.
- The assignments are stored in the `reviews` collection in Firestore.
