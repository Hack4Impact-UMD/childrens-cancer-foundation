# ApplicationForm

This page is the main component for the research and nextgen grant application forms.

## Logic

- It uses a multi-step form structure, with breadcrumbs to navigate between steps.
- The steps include:
  1. About the Grant
  2. Information
  3. Grant Proposal
  4. Review and Submit
- It collects all the form data and submits it to the `submitApplication` Firebase Function.
