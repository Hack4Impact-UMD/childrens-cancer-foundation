# NRApplicationForm

This page is the main component for the non-research grant application form.

## Logic

- It uses a multi-step form structure, similar to the `ApplicationForm`.
- The steps include:
  1. Information
  2. Narrative
  3. Review and Submit
- It collects all the form data and submits it to the `submitApplication` Firebase Function.
